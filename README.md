# PrintIt
A Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 Mod to convert any Minecraft build to a STL file


## Notes:
This mod is VERY unoptimized, currently it will place every block in the STL, not removing the inner verticies it doesn't need. Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjZAgoxFKiQ) video by GamesWithGabe for a more a bit more information on this concept.
